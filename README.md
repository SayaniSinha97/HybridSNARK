# HybridPlonk
This repository contains an implementation of HybridPlonk, a SNARK with linear prover and sublogarithmic proof length. We also provide an implementation of HyperPlonk with SamaritanPCS as its underlying PCS, which serves as a baseline for comparison with HybridPlonk. Consequently, the repo contains the first implementation of SamaritanPCS as well.
